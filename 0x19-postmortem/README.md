# Postmortem: Website Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:
- Duration: Start Time: November 04, 2023, 10:00 PM (PST) - End Time: November 05, 2023, 2:00 AM (PST)

- Impact: The main website interface experienced a complete outage for 30% of the users. Visitors encountered HTTP 503 errors, unable to access pages or services.

## Timeline:
### November 04, 2023:
10:00 PM (PST): Monitoring systems went haywire, alerting us to unusually high server load and traffic - like a friend calling at midnight, worried about the party getting too rowdy.

10:15 PM (PST): Investigated server logs, initially suspecting a DDoS attack - a 'midnight mystery' began.

10:30 PM (PST): Embraced the 'party vibe' by boosting server capacity, hoping for a 'wild night' - perhaps a bit too wild.

10:45 PM (PST): Sounded the alarms for the DevOps and Security teams to join our 'midnight detective' crew.

###  November 05, 2023:
12:00 AM (PST): Unmasked the load balancer misconfiguration, the 'party crasher' behind the server overload.

1:30 AM (PST): Remodelled load balancer settings to spread traffic evenly, and promised an 'all-night surveillance' to keep it in line.

## Root Cause:
- Issue Detection: Proactive monitoring systems triggered alerts indicating unusually high server load and traffic.

- Actions Taken: Investigated the server logs, suspected a DDoS attack, and scaled server capacity.

- Misleading Investigation: Initially assumed a DDoS attack due to sudden traffic spikes.

- Escalated To: Incident was escalated to the DevOps and Security teams.

- Resolution: Upon further analysis, it was identified that a misconfigured load balancer caused the server overload.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- Issue Cause: Misconfiguration of the load balancer settings led to uneven distribution of traffic, overloading certain server nodes.

- Resolution: Load balancer settings were reconfigured to evenly distribute traffic, and additional monitoring was implemented to track load distribution.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
### - Improvements:
  Implementation of more robust load testing scenarios during peak traffic periods.
  Regular audits of server configurations to catch misconfigurations early.

###  - Tasks to Address:
  Conduct load testing drills under various traffic scenarios.
  Implement automated alerts for load balancing irregularities.
  Schedule routine server configuration audits.

## Conclusion:
This incident highlighted the critical need for consistent load balancer monitoring and robust configurations to prevent service disruption during peak traffic periods. By implementing the corrective measures and performing proactive audits, future incidents due to misconfigurations can be mitigated.
